# WordSpy

## Description

WordSpy is a simple word game where inside a match two words exist, a good and a bad word. Of all players the "spy" gets
the bad word while the others get the good word. The spy has to guess the good word while acting like he is one of them,
and the others have to find out who the spy is. The catch: first you have to figure out what you are.
